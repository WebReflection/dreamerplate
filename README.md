dreamerplate
============

a truly cross platform and simplified JS and DOM environment boilerplate

### base
A very basic page to test in console is [base.html](http://webreflection.github.io/dreamerplate/base.html).

Just open the console and start playing with the surrounding environment to feel the dream.
